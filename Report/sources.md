Managing ADHD
DHIs for ADHD support diagnosis, assessment, and interventions that target attention, social-emotional skills, self-regulation, motor skills, and academic and vocational skills. HCI researchers typically follow a user-centered design approach that involves identifying user needs, understanding the context of use, and designing digital tools iteratively and collaboratively ([10](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.876039/full#B10)). This approach involves users in all stages of development, from early design to prototyping to full system development and user studies.

It is incredibly difficult -if not impossible- in a single research study to measure both whether and how people will use the tool and its effects when used properly. needs rtc for clinical validity and use by clinicians
Overall, we found that most projects used mobile technology
(29%) or sensors (38%) to deliver interventions and/or gather data
from children. Interventions were also delivered in the form of
serious games (29%), robots (22%), virtual or augmented reality
(13%), and the web (12%). Most of the interventions were targeted for use in schools
(45%) or homes (16%). Only a few were targeted or tested in
a clinic setting (6%)
